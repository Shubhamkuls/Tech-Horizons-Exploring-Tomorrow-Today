                <p class="article-para">One of the most significant impacts of machine learning is its ability to automate complex processes. From self-driving
                cars to real-time fraud detection, machine learning algorithms can handle tasks that traditionally required human
                intelligence. This automation not only increases efficiency but also reduces costs and minimizes errors.
                For instance, in manufacturing, predictive maintenance powered by machine learning can anticipate equipment failures
                before they occur, saving millions in downtime and repair costs. Similarly, in healthcare, ML models assist in
                diagnosing diseases faster and more accurately than ever before.</p>
